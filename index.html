            On this website you'll have access to some of the things I've seen, done and created.<br> Through each of
            the
            links below or in the menu bar, you will be able to access separate areas of the site based around some of
            my interests.<br><br>

            There will be an area displaying some of my recent travel photography.<br> An area to sample some of my
            current
            music projects which are unfinished and unpublished.<br> And a final section that revolves around my
            interest in
            gaming and includes a working text based adventure which I recently created in the Python programming
            language.
